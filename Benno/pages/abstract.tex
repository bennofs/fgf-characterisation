The forward guarded fragment ($\FGF$) is a recently introduced fragment of first-order logic ($\FO$) which is decidable and has a satisfiability problem that is only $\ExpTime$-complete.
$\FGF$ derives from $\GF$ by adding a restriction on the order in which variables may appear in formulae, similar to the fluted fragment.
$\FGF$ is a higher-arity generalization of multi-modal logic with global modalities, but in contrast to $\GF$ without an inverse modality.

In analogy to the classic van Benthem characterization of modal logic, we show that $\FGF$ is exactly the fragment of $\FO$ which consists of formulae that are invariant under a notion of bisimulation for $\FGF$.
Crucially, we use techniques from Martin Otto which also work if we restrict the class of models under consideration to only finite models.
In the process, we develop a new notion of unraveling for $\FGF$, which produces tree-like models that satisfy the same $\FGF$ formulae as the original model.
The new unraveling is closely linked to an unraveling for $\GF$ and interesting on its own.
As an application, we show that finding an equivalent $\FGF$ formula to a given $\GF$ formula is decidable.
