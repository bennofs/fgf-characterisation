  abstract = {From the early 1930s, there evolved two kinds of mathematical semantics for modal logic. Algebraic semantics interprets modal connectives as operators on Boolean algebras. Relational semantics uses relational structures, often called Kripke models, whose elements are thought of variously as being possible worlds, moments of time, evidential situations, or states of a computer. This chapter reviews these developments in a way that provides some insight into how the present came to be as it is. The pervading theme is the mathematics underlying modal logic, and this has at least three dimensions. To begin with there are the new mathematical ideas: when and why they were introduced, and how they interacted and evolved. Then there is the use of methods and results from other areas of mathematical logic, algebra and topology in the analysis of modal systems. And there is the application of modal syntax and semantics to study notions of mathematical and computational interest.}

  abstract = {Guarded fragments of first-order logic were recently introduced by Andreka, van Benthem and Nemeti; they consist of relational first-order formulae whose quantifiers are appropriately relativized by atoms. These fragments are interesting because they extend in a natural way many propositional modal logics, because they have useful model-theoretic properties and especially because they are decidable classes that avoid the usual syntactic restrictions (on the arity of relation symbols, the quantifier pattern or the number of variables) of almost all other known decidable fragments of first-order logic. Here, we investigate the computational complexity of these fragments. We prove that the satisfiability problems for the guarded fragment (GF) and the loosely guarded fragment (LGF) of first-order logic are complete for deterministic double exponential time. For the subfragments that have only a bounded number of variables or only relation symbols of bounded arity, satisfiability is EXPTIME-complete. We further establish a tree model property for both the guarded fragment and the loosely guarded fragment, and give a proof of the finite model property of the guarded fragment. It is also shown that some natural, modest extensions of the guarded fragments are undecidable.}
