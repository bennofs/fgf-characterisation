  abstract = {From the early 1930s, there evolved two kinds of mathematical semantics for modal logic. Algebraic semantics interprets modal connectives as operators on Boolean algebras. Relational semantics uses relational structures, often called Kripke models, whose elements are thought of variously as being possible worlds, moments of time, evidential situations, or states of a computer. This chapter reviews these developments in a way that provides some insight into how the present came to be as it is. The pervading theme is the mathematics underlying modal logic, and this has at least three dimensions. To begin with there are the new mathematical ideas: when and why they were introduced, and how they interacted and evolved. Then there is the use of methods and results from other areas of mathematical logic, algebra and topology in the analysis of modal systems. And there is the application of modal syntax and semantics to study notions of mathematical and computational interest.}

  abstract = {Guarded fragments of first-order logic were recently introduced by Andreka, van Benthem and Nemeti; they consist of relational first-order formulae whose quantifiers are appropriately relativized by atoms. These fragments are interesting because they extend in a natural way many propositional modal logics, because they have useful model-theoretic properties and especially because they are decidable classes that avoid the usual syntactic restrictions (on the arity of relation symbols, the quantifier pattern or the number of variables) of almost all other known decidable fragments of first-order logic. Here, we investigate the computational complexity of these fragments. We prove that the satisfiability problems for the guarded fragment (GF) and the loosely guarded fragment (LGF) of first-order logic are complete for deterministic double exponential time. For the subfragments that have only a bounded number of variables or only relation symbols of bounded arity, satisfiability is EXPTIME-complete. We further establish a tree model property for both the guarded fragment and the loosely guarded fragment, and give a proof of the finite model property of the guarded fragment. It is also shown that some natural, modest extensions of the guarded fragments are undecidable.}

In this paper, we introduce model comparison games for the basic Horn description logic hornALC (corresponding to the basic Horn modal logic) and use them to obtain an Ehrenfeucht-Fra{\textasciidieresis}{\i}sse{\textasciiacute} type definability result and a van Benthem style expressive completeness result for hornALC. We also establish a finite model theory version of the latter. The Ehrenfeucht-Fra{\textasciidieresis}{\i}sse{\textasciiacute} type definability result is used to show that checking hornALC indistinguishability of models is EXPTIME-complete, which is in sharp contrast to ALC indistinguishability (i.e., bisimulation equivalence) checkable in PTIME. In addition, we explore the behavior of Horn fragments of more expressive description and modal logics by defining a Horn guarded fragment of first-order logic and introducing model comparison games for it.},

TBoxes of ALC, ALCI and ALCQ are characterised as fragments of FO which are invariant under global bisimulation and disjoint unions. The logics ALCO, ALCQO and ALCQIO, which incorporate individuals, are characterised w.r.t. to the class K of all interpretations which interpret individuals as singleton sets. The characterisations for TBoxes of ALCO and ALCQO both require additionally that an FO-sentence is, under certain circumstances, preserved under forward generated subinterpretations. FO-sentences equivalent to ALCQIO-TBoxes, are - due to ALCQIO's inverse roles - characterised similarly but are required to be preserved under generated subinterpretations. EL as sub-boolean DL is characterised on concept level as the FO-fragment which is preserved under simulation and preserved under direct products. Equally valid is the characterisation by being preserved under simulation and having minimal models. For EL-TBoxes, a global version of simulation was not sufficient but FO-sentences of EL-TBoxes are invariant under global equi-simulation, disjoint unions and direct products. For each of these description logics, the characteristic concepts are explicated and the characterisation is accompanied by an investigation under which notion of saturation the logic in hand enjoys the Hennessy-and-Milner-Property. As application of the results we determine the minimal globally bisimilar companion w.r.t. ALCQO-bisimulation and introduce the L1-to-L2-rewritability problem for TBoxes, where L1 and L2 are (description) logics. The latter is the problem to decide whether or not an L1-TBox can be equivalently expressed as L2-TBox. We give algorithms which decide ALCI-to-ALC-rewritability and ALC-to-EL-rewritability.

Coalgebraic predicate logic (CPL), a generalization of a neighbourhood-based first-order logic introduced by Chang, has been identified as a natural first-order extension of coalgebraic modal logic, which in particular coincides with the standard first-order correspondence language when instantiated to Kripke-style relational modal operators. Here, we generalize to the CPL setting the classical van Benthem/Rosen theorem stating that both over arbitrary and over finite models, modal logic is precisely the bisimulation-invariant fragment of first-order logic. As instances of this generic result, we obtain corresponding characterizations for, e.g. conditional logic, neighbourhood logic (i.e. classical modal logic) and monotone modal logic.}

The fragment is one-dimensional in the sense that quantification is limited to applications of blocks of existential (universal) quantifiers such that at most one variable remains free in the quantified formula. The fragment is closed under Boolean operations, but additional restrictions (called uniformity conditions) apply to combinations of atomic formulae with two or more variables. We argue that the notions of one-dimensionality and uniformity together offer a novel perspective on the robust decidability of modal logics. We also establish that minor modifications to the restrictions of the syntax of the one-dimensional fragment lead to undecidable formalisms. Namely, the two-dimensional and non-uniform one-dimensional fragments are shown undecidable. Finally, we prove that with regard to expressivity, the one-dimensional fragment is incomparable with both the guarded negation fragment and two-variable logic with counting. Our proof of the decidability of the one-dimensional fragment is based on a technique involving a direct reduction to the monadic class of first-order logic. The novel technique is itself of an independent mathematical interest.},

  abstract = {How can we prove that some fragment of a given logic has the power to define precisely all structural properties that satisfy some characteristic semantic preservation condition? This issue is a fundamental one for classical model theory and applications in non-classical settings alike. While methods differ greatly, and while the classical methods can usually not be matched for instance in the setting of finite model theory, this note surveys some interesting commonality revolving around the use and availability of tractable representatives in the relevant model classes. The construction of models in which simple invariants like partial types based on some weak fragment control all the relevant structural properties, may be seen at the heart of such questions. We highlight some constructions involving degrees of acyclicity and saturation that can be achieved in finite model constructions, and discuss their uses towards expressive completeness w.r.t. bisimulation based equivalences in hypergraphs and relational structures. The emphasis is on the combinatorial challenges in such more constructive approaches that work in non-classical settings and especially in finite model theory. One new result concerns expressive completeness w.r.t. guarded negation bisimulation, a back-and-forth equivalence involving local homomorphisms.},
