  abstract = {From the early 1930s, there evolved two kinds of mathematical semantics for modal logic. Algebraic semantics interprets modal connectives as operators on Boolean algebras. Relational semantics uses relational structures, often called Kripke models, whose elements are thought of variously as being possible worlds, moments of time, evidential situations, or states of a computer. This chapter reviews these developments in a way that provides some insight into how the present came to be as it is. The pervading theme is the mathematics underlying modal logic, and this has at least three dimensions. To begin with there are the new mathematical ideas: when and why they were introduced, and how they interacted and evolved. Then there is the use of methods and results from other areas of mathematical logic, algebra and topology in the analysis of modal systems. And there is the application of modal syntax and semantics to study notions of mathematical and computational interest.}

  abstract = {Guarded fragments of first-order logic were recently introduced by Andreka, van Benthem and Nemeti; they consist of relational first-order formulae whose quantifiers are appropriately relativized by atoms. These fragments are interesting because they extend in a natural way many propositional modal logics, because they have useful model-theoretic properties and especially because they are decidable classes that avoid the usual syntactic restrictions (on the arity of relation symbols, the quantifier pattern or the number of variables) of almost all other known decidable fragments of first-order logic. Here, we investigate the computational complexity of these fragments. We prove that the satisfiability problems for the guarded fragment (GF) and the loosely guarded fragment (LGF) of first-order logic are complete for deterministic double exponential time. For the subfragments that have only a bounded number of variables or only relation symbols of bounded arity, satisfiability is EXPTIME-complete. We further establish a tree model property for both the guarded fragment and the loosely guarded fragment, and give a proof of the finite model property of the guarded fragment. It is also shown that some natural, modest extensions of the guarded fragments are undecidable.}

In this paper, we introduce model comparison games for the basic Horn description logic hornALC (corresponding to the basic Horn modal logic) and use them to obtain an Ehrenfeucht-Fra{\textasciidieresis}{\i}sse{\textasciiacute} type definability result and a van Benthem style expressive completeness result for hornALC. We also establish a finite model theory version of the latter. The Ehrenfeucht-Fra{\textasciidieresis}{\i}sse{\textasciiacute} type definability result is used to show that checking hornALC indistinguishability of models is EXPTIME-complete, which is in sharp contrast to ALC indistinguishability (i.e., bisimulation equivalence) checkable in PTIME. In addition, we explore the behavior of Horn fragments of more expressive description and modal logics by defining a Horn guarded fragment of first-order logic and introducing model comparison games for it.},

TBoxes of ALC, ALCI and ALCQ are characterised as fragments of FO which are invariant under global bisimulation and disjoint unions. The logics ALCO, ALCQO and ALCQIO, which incorporate individuals, are characterised w.r.t. to the class K of all interpretations which interpret individuals as singleton sets. The characterisations for TBoxes of ALCO and ALCQO both require additionally that an FO-sentence is, under certain circumstances, preserved under forward generated subinterpretations. FO-sentences equivalent to ALCQIO-TBoxes, are - due to ALCQIO's inverse roles - characterised similarly but are required to be preserved under generated subinterpretations. EL as sub-boolean DL is characterised on concept level as the FO-fragment which is preserved under simulation and preserved under direct products. Equally valid is the characterisation by being preserved under simulation and having minimal models. For EL-TBoxes, a global version of simulation was not sufficient but FO-sentences of EL-TBoxes are invariant under global equi-simulation, disjoint unions and direct products. For each of these description logics, the characteristic concepts are explicated and the characterisation is accompanied by an investigation under which notion of saturation the logic in hand enjoys the Hennessy-and-Milner-Property. As application of the results we determine the minimal globally bisimilar companion w.r.t. ALCQO-bisimulation and introduce the L1-to-L2-rewritability problem for TBoxes, where L1 and L2 are (description) logics. The latter is the problem to decide whether or not an L1-TBox can be equivalently expressed as L2-TBox. We give algorithms which decide ALCI-to-ALC-rewritability and ALC-to-EL-rewritability.

Coalgebraic predicate logic (CPL), a generalization of a neighbourhood-based first-order logic introduced by Chang, has been identified as a natural first-order extension of coalgebraic modal logic, which in particular coincides with the standard first-order correspondence language when instantiated to Kripke-style relational modal operators. Here, we generalize to the CPL setting the classical van Benthem/Rosen theorem stating that both over arbitrary and over finite models, modal logic is precisely the bisimulation-invariant fragment of first-order logic. As instances of this generic result, we obtain corresponding characterizations for, e.g. conditional logic, neighbourhood logic (i.e. classical modal logic) and monotone modal logic.}

  abstract = {How can we prove that some fragment of a given logic has the power to define precisely all structural properties that satisfy some characteristic semantic preservation condition? This issue is a fundamental one for classical model theory and applications in non-classical settings alike. While methods differ greatly, and while the classical methods can usually not be matched for instance in the setting of finite model theory, this note surveys some interesting commonality revolving around the use and availability of tractable representatives in the relevant model classes. The construction of models in which simple invariants like partial types based on some weak fragment control all the relevant structural properties, may be seen at the heart of such questions. We highlight some constructions involving degrees of acyclicity and saturation that can be achieved in finite model constructions, and discuss their uses towards expressive completeness w.r.t. bisimulation based equivalences in hypergraphs and relational structures. The emphasis is on the combinatorial challenges in such more constructive approaches that work in non-classical settings and especially in finite model theory. One new result concerns expressive completeness w.r.t. guarded negation bisimulation, a back-and-forth equivalence involving local homomorphisms.},

  abstract = {Lindstr{\textbackslash}"om theorems characterize logics in terms of model-theoretic conditions such as Compactness and the L{\textbackslash}"owenheim-Skolem property. Most existing characterizations of this kind concern extensions of first-order logic. But on the other hand, many logics relevant to computer science are fragments or extensions of fragments of first-order logic, e.g., k-variable logics and various modal logics. Finding Lindstr{\textbackslash}"om theorems for these languages can be challenging, as most known techniques rely on coding arguments that seem to require the full expressive power of first-order logic. In this paper, we provide Lindstr{\textbackslash}"om theorems for several fragments of first-order logic, including the k-variable fragments for k{$>$}2, Tarski's relation algebra, graded modal logic, and the binary guarded fragment. We use two different proof techniques. One is a modification of the original Lindstr{\textbackslash}"om proof. The other involves the modal concepts of bisimulation, tree unraveling, and finite depth. Our results also imply semantic preservation theorems.}

  abstract = {Guarded fixed-point logic {$\mu$}GF extends the guarded fragment by means of least and greatest fixed points, and thus plays the same role within the domain of guarded logics as the modal {$\mu$}-calculus plays within the modal domain. We provide a semantic characterization of {$\mu$}GF within an appropriate fragment of second-order logic, in terms of invariance under guarded bisimulation. The corresponding characterization of the modal {$\mu$}-calculus, due to Janin and Walukiewicz, is lifted from the modal to the guarded domain by means of model theoretic translations. Guarded second-order logic, the fragment of second-order logic which is introduced in the context of our characterization theorem, captures a natural and robust level of expressiveness with several equivalent characterizations. For a wide range of issues in guarded logics it may take up a role similar to that of monadic second-order in relation to modal logics. At the more general methodological level, the translations between the guarded and modal domains make the intuitive analogy between guarded and modal logics available as a tool in the further analysis of the model theory of guarded logics.}

Chang: a natural and generic correspondence language for any types of structures which can be recast as Set-coalgebras. We discuss axiomatization and completeness results for two natural classes of such logics. Moreover, we show that an entirely general completeness result is not possible. We study the expressive power of our language, contrasting it with both coalgebraic modal logic and existing first-order proposals for special classes of Set-coalgebras (apart for relational structures, also neighbourhood frames and topological spaces). The semantic characterization of expressivity is based on the fact that our language inherits a coalgebraic variant of the Van Benthem-Rosen Theorem. Basic model-theoretic constructions and results, in particular ultraproducts, obtain for the two classes which allow for completeness---and in some cases beyond that.},

It was shown that U1 has the exponential model property and NEXPTIME-complete satisfiability problem. In this paper we investigate two restrictions of U1 that still contain FO2. We call these logics RU1 and SU1, or the restricted and strongly restricted uniform one-dimensional fragments. We introduce Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse games for the logics and prove that while SU1 and RU1 are expressively equivalent, they are strictly contained in U1. Furthermore, we consider extensions of the logics SU1, RU1 and U1 with unrestricted use of a single built-in equivalence relation E. We prove that while all the obtained systems retain the finite model property, their complexities differ. Namely, the satisfiability problem is NEXPTIME-complete for SU1(E) and 2NEXPTIME-complete for both RU1(E) and U1(E). Finally, we show undecidability of some natural extensions of SU1.},
