\section{Bisimulations and Games}\label{sec:games}
\noindent \textbf{Bisimulations for guarded fragments.}
%
We next present notion of bisimulation relations tailored towards $\GF$ and $\FGF$, based on presentations from~\cite[Sec. 2.2.3]{Otto04} and~\cite[Sec. 2]{BednarczykJ22}.

For structures $\str{A}$ and $\str{B}$ we denote with $\PartIso{\str{A}}{\str{B}}$ the set of all partial isomorphisms between $\str{A}$ and $\str{B}$.
For non-empty $\bisimY, \bisimZ \subseteq \PartIso{\str{A}}{\str{B}}$ we say that $\bisimZ$ satisfies back-and-forth conditions for $\bisimY$ if for every partial isomorphism $\partisof \in \bisimY$ we have:
%
\begin{description}\itemsep0em
  \item[\desclabel{(Forth)}{bisim:forth}] For every live $\elemtuplea$ in $\str{A}$, there is $\partisog \in \bisimZ$ with the domain $\set(\elemtuplea)$ such that $\partisof$ and $\partisog$ agree on their common domain.
  \item[\desclabel{(Back)}{bisim:back}] For every live $\elemtupleb$ in $\str{B}$, there is $\partisog \in \bisimZ$ with the image $\set(\elemtuplea)$ such that $\partisof$ and $\partisog$ agree on their common image.
\end{description}
A non-empty set $\bisimZ \subseteq \PartIso{\str{A}}{\str{B}}$ is a $\GF$-\emph{bisimulation} between $\str{A}$ and $\str{B}$ if it itself satisfies \ref{bisim:forth} and~\ref{bisim:back} conditions given above.
An $\ell$-$\GF$-bisimulation between $\str{A}$ and $\str{B}$ is a sequence of sets $\bisimZ_0, \bisimZ_1, \ldots, \bisimZ_\ell \subseteq \PartIso{\str{A}}{\str{B}}$ such that for all $i < \ell$ we have that $\bisimZ_i$ satisfies~\ref{bisim:forth} and~\ref{bisim:back} conditions for $\bisimZ_{i{+}1}$.
We say that pointed structures $(\str{A}, \elemtuplea)$ and~$(\str{B}, \elemtupleb)$ are $\GF$-\emph{bisimilar}, denoted $(\str{A}, \elemtuplea) \bisimto_{\GF} (\str{B}, \elemtupleb)$, if there exists a $\GF$-bisimulation between $\str{A}$ and $\str{B}$ containing the partial isomorphism that maps $\elemtuplea$ to $\elemtupleb$.
We analogously speak about $\ell$-$\GF$-\emph{bisimilarity} and employ the notation $(\str{A}, \elemtuplea) \bisimto_{\GF}^{\ell} (\str{B}, \elemtupleb)$.
We use the notation $\elemtuplea \bisimto_{\GF} \elemtupleb$ or $\elemtuplea \bisimto_{\GF}^{\ell} \elemtupleb$ if the structures $\str{A}$ and $\str{B}$ are clear from the context.

The following classical lemma links bisimulations and logical~equivalence.
\begin{lemma}[Thm. 1.12 of~\cite{Gradel014}]\label{lemma:GF-bisimulations-work-well}
For every pair of pointed structures $(\str{A}, \elemtuplea)$ and~$(\str{B}, \elemtupleb)$ we have that:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $(\str{A}, \elemtuplea) \bisimto_{\GF} (\str{B}, \elemtupleb)$ implies $(\str{A}, \elemtuplea) \equiv_{\GF} (\str{B}, \elemtupleb)$;
\item $(\str{A}, \elemtuplea) \bisimto_{\GF}^{\ell} (\str{B}, \elemtupleb)$ implies $(\str{A}, \elemtuplea) \equiv_{\GF_\ell} (\str{B}, \elemtupleb)$ for all $\ell \in \N$;
\end{enumerate}
Moreover, the converse holds for $\omega$-saturated $\str{A}$ and $\str{B}$.
\end{lemma}

The following example presents $\GF$-bisimilar structures that can be distinguished by a first-order formula.
\begin{example}
  Consider an $\FO[\{\relE\}]$-formula $\varphi \deff \exists{x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}}(\relE(x_{1}, x_{2}) \land \relE(x_{2}, x_{3}) \land \relE(x_{3}, x_{1}))$, and structures $\str{A}$, and $\str{B}$ depicted below.
  \begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={draw,circle}, baseline=(current bounding box.north)]
    \begin{scope}[xshift=-70]
    \node[draw=none, font=\Large] {$\str{A}$};
    \path[->]
      (0,1) node(n1) {1}
      (-1,-1) node(n2) {2}
      (1,-1) node(n3) {3}
      (n1) edge (n2)
      (n2) edge (n3)
      (n3) edge (n1);
    \end{scope}

    \node[draw=none, font=\Large] {$\bisimto_{\GF}$};

    \begin{scope}[xshift=70]
    \node[draw=none, font=\Large] {$\str{B}$};
    \path[->]
      (-1,1) node(n1) {a}
      (-1,-1) node(n2) {b}
      (1,-1) node(n3) {c}
      (1,1) node(n4) {d}
      (n1) edge (n2)
      (n2) edge (n3)
      (n3) edge (n4)
      (n4) edge (n1);
    \end{scope}
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{figure}
  By design we clearly have $\str{A}\models \varphi$ and $\str{B} \not\models \varphi$. On the other hand, $\str{A}$ and $\str{B}$ are $\GF$-bisimilar, witnessed by the bisimulation $\bisimZ$ consisting of the partial isomorphisms:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $s_{1} \mapsto t_{1}$ for every $s_{1} \in \{1,2,3\}$ and $t_{1} \in \{a,b,c,d\}$, and
    \item $s_{1}s_{2} \mapsto t_{1}t_{2}$ for every $s_{1}s_{2} \in \{12,23,31\}$ and $t_{1}t_{2} \in \{ab,bc,cd,da\}$
  \end{itemize}
  where $s_{1}s_{2} \mapsto t_{1}t_{2}$ denotes the partial isomorphism mapping the element $s_{1}$ to $t_{1}$ and the element $s_{2}$ to $t_{2}$.
\end{example}

\noindent
Now a similar characterisation can be provided for $\FGF$.
Due to the ``forwardness'' of the underlying logic, it is convenient to think about maps as tuples.
A \emph{system of forward partial maps} between structures $\str{A}$ and $\str{B}$ is any non-empty subset of $\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} (A^i \times B^i)$ satisfying:
\begin{description}\itemsep0em
  \item[\desclabel{(AtomicEq)}{bisim:atomiceq}] For all $(\elemtuplea, \elemtupleb) \in \bisimZ$ we have that $\elemtuplea$, $\elemtupleb$ are live and $\atp{\FGF}{\str{A}}{\elemtuplea} = \atp{\FGF}{\str{B}}{\elemtupleb}$~holds.
\end{description}
For our fixed signature $\Sigma$, the infinite union $\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} (A^i \times B^i)$ in this definition may be replaced by the finite union $\bigcup_{i=1}^{\arity(\Sigma)} (A^i \times B^i)$, since live tuples cannot have more than $\arity(\Sigma)$ components.
If $\bisimZ, \bisimZ'$ are systems of forward partial maps between $\str{A}$ and $\str{B}$, we say that $\bisimZ'$ satisfies back-and-forth conditions for $\bisimZ$ if for every $(\elemtuplea, \elemtupleb) \in \bisimZ$ the following conditions hold:
\begin{description}\itemsep0em
  \item[\desclabel{(fForth)}{bisim:fforth}] For every (possibly empty) infix $\elemtuplecfromto{i}{j}$ of $\elemtuplec$ and a live tuple $\elemtuplee$ in $\str{A}$ such that $\elemtuplecfromto{i}{j} = \elemtupleefromto{1}{j{-}i{+}1}$ there is a live tuple $\elemtuplef$ with $\elemtupledfromto{i}{j} = \elemtupleffromto{1}{j{-}i{+}1}$ such that $(\elemtuplee, \elemtuplef) \in \bisimZ'$ holds.
  %
  \item[\desclabel{(fBack)}{bisim:fback}] For every (possibly empty) infix $\elemtupledfromto{i}{j}$ of $\elemtupled$ and a live tuple $\elemtuplef$ in $\str{B}$ such that $\elemtupledfromto{i}{j} = \elemtupleffromto{1}{j{-}i{+}1}$ there is a live tuple $\elemtuplee$ with $\elemtuplecfromto{i}{j} = \elemtupleefromto{1}{j{-}i{+}1}$ such that $(\elemtuplee, \elemtuplef) \in \bisimZ'$~holds.
\end{description}
A system of forward partial maps $\bisimZ$ between $\str{A}$ and $\str{B}$ is an $\FGF$-\emph{bisimulation} between $\str{A}$ and $\str{B}$ if it itself satisfies the above conditions.
An $\ell$-$\FGF$-bisimulation between $\str{A}$ and $\str{B}$ is a sequence $\bisimZ_0, \bisimZ_1, \ldots, \bisimZ_\ell$ of systems of forward partial maps between $\str{A}$ and $\str{B}$ such that for all $i < \ell$ we have that $\bisimZ_i$ satisfies~\ref{bisim:fforth} and~\ref{bisim:fback} conditions for $\bisimZ_{i{+}1}$.
We~speak about $\FGF$-\emph{bisimilar} and $\ell$-$\FGF$-\emph{bisimilar} (pointed) structures in total analogy to the guarded-fragment case.
We stress that the back-and-forth conditions allow for choosing an empty infix, so $\ell$-$\FGF$-bisimulations are not limited to the local neighbourhood of some tuple.
Instead, even for $\ell = 1$, every guarded tuple must be mapped to a tuple in the other structure.

A ``forward'' counterpart of \cref{lemma:GF-bisimulations-work-well} is presented below.
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:FGF-bisimulations-work-well}
For every pair of pointed structures $(\str{A}, \elemtuplea)$ and~$(\str{B}, \elemtupleb)$ we have that:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $(\str{A}, \elemtuplea) \bisimto_{\FGF} (\str{B}, \elemtupleb)$ implies $(\str{A}, \elemtuplea) \equiv_{\FGF} (\str{B}, \elemtupleb)$;
\item $(\str{A}, \elemtuplea) \bisimto_{\FGF}^{\ell} (\str{B}, \elemtupleb)$ implies $(\str{A}, \elemtuplea) \equiv_{\FGF_\ell} (\str{B}, \elemtupleb)$ for all $\ell \in \N$;
\end{enumerate}
Moreover, the converse holds for $\omega$-saturated $\str{A}$ and $\str{B}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proofsketch}
  A proof for condition \textbf{(a)} is provided in~\cite[Lemma 3]{BednarczykJ22}.
  The proof for condition \textbf{(b)} uses the same ideas as the proof for \textbf{(a)}.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
          For the ``if'' direction, we perform induction over $\ell$ and use~\ref{bisim:fforth} to obtain a witness in $\str{B}$ for every existential quantifier that has a witness in $\str{A}$ (by properties of $\models$, it suffixes to consider existential quantifiers as $\forall\vartuplex\ \cdots \iff \lnot \exists \vartuplex\ \cdots$).
    \item
          For the opposite direction, we show that the set of pairs of tuples from $\str{A}$ and $\str{B}$ with the same $\FGF_{\ell}$-type is an $\ell$-$\FGF$-bisimulation.
          Let $\elemtuplec \sqin A$ and $\elemtupled \sqin B$ be live tuples with equal $\FGF_{\ell}$-types.
          Consider any tuple $\elemtuplee$ extending an infix $\elemtuplecfromto{i}{j}$ to a new live tuple $\elemtuplecfromto{i}{j}\elemtuplee$.
          Let $\Gamma$ be the $\FGF_{k-1}$-type of $\elemtuplee$ with regards to $\elemtuplecfromto{i}{j}$.
          Because of $\omega$-saturation, this type is realized in $\str{B}$ if every of its finite subsets is realized.
          For every finite subset of $\Gamma$, we can construct an $\FGF_{k}$-formula that asserts the existence of a witness realizing this finite $\FGF_{k-1}$-type.
          Hence by $k$-$\FGF$-equivalence, there exists a tuple $\elemtuplef$ that extends $\elemtupledfromto{i}{j}$ and same $\FGF_{k-1}$-type.
          Therefore, the set of pairs of tuples with equal $\FGF_{\ell}$-types is an $\ell$-$\FGF$-bisimulation, satisfying the theorem.
  \end{itemize}
\end{proofsketch}
\input{proofs/FGF-bisimulations-work-well}

The following example presents two structures that are $\FGF$-bisimilar but not $\GF$-bisimilar.
\begin{example}
  Consider the two structures $\str{A} := \tikz[baseline=-0.5ex]{\path[->] (0,0) node[draw,circle] (n1) {} (n1) edge[loop above,in=70,out=110,looseness=10] (n1);}$ and $\str{B} := \tikz[baseline=-0.5ex]{\path[->] (0,0) node (n1) [draw,circle] {} (3em,0) node (n2) [draw,circle] {} (n1) edge[bend left] (n2) (n2) edge[bend left] (n1);}$ with a binary predicate $\relE$ interpreted as edges. These two structures are $\FGF[\{\relE\}]$-bisimilar, while a $\GF$-sentence $\exists{\varx_1}\relE(\varx_1,\varx_1)$ can distinguish them.

\end{example}

Both $\GF$-bisimulation and $\FGF$-bisimulation naturally correspond to games~\cite[Sec. 1.2.1]{Gradel014}.
We focus on the the game corresponding to $\FGF$-bisimulation here.
The $\FGF$-\emph{bisimulation game} is played on two pointed structures $(\str{A}, \elemtuplea)$ and $(\str{B}, \elemtupleb)$ by two players, Spoiler and Duplicator.
The game starts by selecting the tuples $\elemtuplea$ and $\elemtupleb$ from the corresponding structures.
Throughout the game, Duplicator must maintain the condition that the two currently selected tuples have equal atomic-$\FGF$-types.
If $\elemtuplea$ and $\elemtupleb$ already do not have the same atomic $\FGF$-type, then Duplicator loses instantly.
Otherwise, the game proceeds in rounds.
In each round, Spoiler first chooses a structure.
As the game is symmetric, let us assume that spoiler chooses the structure $\str{A}$.
Spoiler then selects an infix $\elemtupleafromto{i}{j}$ of the currently selected tuple and a new live tuple $\elemtuplec$ which has $\elemtupleafromto{i}{j}$ as a prefix.
For convenience, we use the terms \emph{shared elements} for the prefix $\elemtuplecfromto{1}{j-i+1}$ and \emph{unshared elements} for the remaining elements, namely $\elemtuplecfromto{j-i+1+1}{|\elemtuplec|}$.
Duplicator, in order to continue the game, must then find a live tuple $\elemtupled$ in $\str{B}$ having $\elemtuplebfromto{i}{j}$ as prefix such that $\elemtuplec$ and $\elemtupled$ have equal $\FGF$-types.
Note that Spoiler may choose an index $j$ that is not maximal, so that the situation of $a_{j+1} = c_{j-i+1+1}$ is still possible.
We still regard $c_{j-i+1+1}$ as an unshared element, since Duplicator is allowed to pick a tuple $\elemtupled$ where $b_{j+1} \neq d_{j-i+1+1}$.
The game then continues with the next round, with $\elemtuplec$ and $\elemtupled$ as the new starting tuples.
Spoiler wins the game if Duplicator is unable to respond, i.e.\ to find suitable tuples.
Duplicator wins otherwise.
It is easy to see that the possible moves of Spoiler are analogous to the back-and-forth conditions for $\FGF$-bisimulation, as is also the case for the $\GF$-game~\cite[Sec.\ 3.2]{Gradel014}.
To win, Duplicator must be able to respond to any move that Spoiler makes.
A winning strategy for Duplicator thus corresponds to an $\FGF$-bisimulation between the two structures, and vice-versa.
If we restrict the game to only $\ell$-rounds, where the winning condition for Duplicator is that Spoiler cannot win in the first $\ell$-rounds, then the game is equivalent (in the aforementioned sense) to the existence of an $\ell$-FGF-bisimulation between $\str{A}, \elemtuplea$ and $\str{B}, \elemtupleb$.
We collect these observations in the following corollary:

\begin{corollary}
  In the $\FGF$-game played on structures $\str{A}, \elemtuplea$ and $\str{B}, \elemtupleb$:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Duplicator has as winning strategy if and only if $\str{A}, \elemtuplea \bisimto_{\FGF} \str{B}, \elemtupleb$,
    \item Duplicator has a winning strategy for $\ell$ rounds if and only if $\str{A}, \elemtuplea \bisimto_{\FGF}^{\ell} \str{B}, \elemtupleb$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{corollary}

Let $\str{A}, \elemtuplea^{(0)}$ be a pointed structure where $\elemtuplea^{(0)}$ is just tuple of elements from $A$, labelled with a zero index as it is the starting tuple for the unraveling.
We define a \emph{bisimulation sequence} as a sequence of moves that Spoiler takes in one of the possible plays of the $\FGF$-bisimulation game involving this structure, excluding moves where Spoiler picks an empty infix.
Formally, an $\ell$-\emph{bisimulation sequence} is a word in $A^*{(\N\N{}A^{*})}^{\ell}$, represented by a sequence of the form $\elemtuplea^{(0)}(i^{(1)}, j^{(1)})\elemtuplea^{(1)}\cdots(i^{(\ell)}, j^{(\ell)})\elemtuplea^{(\ell)}$, where each $a^{(k)}$ is a live tuple from $\str{A}$ and $i^{(k)}, j^{(k)}$ are indices with $i < j$ for which $\elemtupleafromto{i^{(k)}}{j^{(k)}}^{(k-1)} = \elemtupleafromto{1}{j^{(k)}-i^{(k)}+1}^{k}$.
Bisimulation sequences are denoted by greek letters $\rho, \sigma, \theta, \ldots$ and for
a bisimulation sequence $\sigma$ we refer to the parameter $\ell$ in the above definition as the \emph{level} of $\sigma$.
We say that a sequence $\theta$ \emph{extends} a sequence $\rho$ is $\rho$ is a prefix of $\theta$.
Intuitively, the set $\Seq{A}$ of all bisimulation sequences for a structure $\str{A}$ collects all possible ways in which Spoiler can explore this structure.
For any $\ell$-bisimulation sequence, if $\str{B}, \elemtupleb^{(0)}$ is a structure that is \FGF-bisimilar to $\str{A}, \elemtuplea^{(0)}$, then we can apply~\ref{bisim:fforth} $\ell$ times to find tuples $\elemtupleb^{1}, \ldots, \elemtupleb^{\ell}$ for a corresponding bisimulation sequence in $\str{B}$.
These represent the moves of Duplicator in the game.
Below are some examples of bisimulation sequences:
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
    \begin{minipage}[t]{0.2\textwidth}
        \raggedleft%
        \vspace{0pt}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{res/example-struct-1}

      \newcommand{\tupt}{{\color{tolbrightGreen}\elemtuplet}}%
      \newcommand{\tupq}{{\color{tolbrightPurple}\elemtupleq}}%
      The picture on the left shows a structure with the relations: $(1,2,3) \in \relS^{\str{A}}$, $(2,3,4) \in \relP^{\str{A}}$, $(3,4,5) \in \relT^{\str{A}}$, $(4,5) \in \relQ^{\str{A}}$.

      \vspace{1ex}
      Let $\tups = (1, 2, 3), \tupp = (2, 3, 4), \tupt = (3, 4, 5), \tupq = (4,5)$.

      \vspace{1ex}
      Some examples of bisimulation sequences in this structure are:
      \begin{itemize}
          \item $\tups(3,3)\tupt$,
          \item $\tups(2,3)\tupp(2,3)\tupt$.
      \end{itemize}

      Bisimulation sequences are not required to use maximal infixes, so the following are also valid bisimulation sequences:
      \begin{itemize}
          \item $\tups(2,2)\tupp$,
          \item $\tups(3,3)\tupt(2,2)\tupq$.
      \end{itemize}
      }
    \end{minipage}
    \caption{Examples of bisimulation sequences.}%
    \label{fig:bisim-seq-examples}
\end{figure}

Let $\Seq{\str{A}}$ be the set of all bisimulation sequences for a structure $\str{A}$.
There is a natural projection from a bisimulation sequence $\sigma \in \Seq{A}$ to tuples of $\str{A}$: for $\sigma = \cdots (i,j) \elemtuples$, we define the projection $\Pi(\sigma)$ as $\Pi(\sigma) = \elemtuples$.
Intuitively, this projection gives the tuple of selected elements in the bisimulation game after playing the moves of $\sigma$.

To construct the domain of the unraveling, we combine bisimulation sequences with natural numbers.
This allows us to define a projection that maps to individual elements of $\str{A}$, instead of tuples.
A \emph{tagged bisimulation sequence} of a structure $\str{A}$ is a tuple $(\sigma, k) \in \Seq{A} \times \mathbb{N}$ such that
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\sigma = \elemtuplea$, $k \ge 1$ and $k \le |\elemtuplea|$ for some $\elemtuplea \sqin A$, or
  \item $\sigma = \cdots (i,j) \elemtuplea$, $k \ge (j-i+1) + 1$ and $k \le |\elemtuplea|$ for some $\elemtuplea \sqin A$.
\end{itemize}
For more background on these conditions, see \cref{ex:tagged-bisim-seq}.
The \emph{domain of the unraveling} for a structure $\str{A}$, denoted by $\unraveldom{A}$, is the set of all tagged bisimulation sequences of the structure $\str{A}$.
For a tagged bisimulation sequence $e \in \unraveldom{A}$ that can be decomposed as $e = (\rho, k)$, we use the notation $\seq{e} = \rho$ and $\ctr{e} = k$ to denote the sequence and the counter of this tagged bisimulation sequence, respectively.
Since the counter is an index into the components of $\Pi(\seq{e})$, we can define the projection $\pi(e)$ from tagged bisimulation sequences to elements of $A$ as: $\pi(e) = \Pi(\seq{e})_{\ctr{e}} = \elema_{\ctr{e}}$ for $\seq{e} = \cdots\elemtuplea$.
\begin{example}\label{ex:tagged-bisim-seq}
   {%
     \newcommand{\tups}{{\color{tolbrightYellowDarker}\elemtuples}}%
     \newcommand{\tupt}{{\color{tolbrightGreen}\elemtuplet}}%
     \newcommand{\es}{{\color{tolbrightYellowDarker}s}}%
     \newcommand{\et}{{\color{tolbrightGreen}t}}%
     Consider the bisimulation sequences from \cref{fig:bisim-seq-examples}.
     The tagged bisimulation sequences for the level-0 bisimulation sequence $\sigma$ with $\sigma = \tups$ are: $a = (\sigma, 1)$, $b = (\sigma, 2)$ and $c = (\sigma, 3)$.
     These project to the components of the tuple $\tups$: $\pi(a) = \es_{1} = 1$, $\pi(b) = \es_{2} = 2$ and $\pi(c) = \es_{3} = 3$.
     Now consider the bisimulation sequence $\rho$ with $\rho = \tups(3,3)\tupt$.
     Recalling the bisimulation game, this sequence represents the move from $\tups$ to $\tupt$, sharing the element ``3''.
     There are tagged bisimulation sequences $d = (\rho, 2)$ and $e = (\rho, 3)$ which project to the domain elements ``4'' and ``5''.
     However, there is no tagged bisimulation sequence for the sequence $\rho$ that projects to ``3''.
     While $(\rho, 1)$ projects to ``3'' according to the definition of $\pi$, it is not a tagged bisimulation sequence as it violates the ``$k \ge (j-i+1) + 1$'' condition in the above definition.
     Note that $c = (\sigma, 3)$ projects to ``3'', so there already is a tagged bisimulation sequence that projects to ``3'', using the sequence $\sigma$.
     Intuitively, the condition ensures that for the move from a tuple $\tups$ to a tuple $\tupt$ in the game, there is at most one tagged bisimulation sequence projecting to each shared element.
     Stated differently, tagged bisimulation sequences correspond one-to-one to unshared elements of moves in the bisimulation game.
