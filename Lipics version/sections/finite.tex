\section{Finite Companions}\label{sec:finite}
Let $\unravel{A}, \elemtuptuplea$ be a tree unraveling of a finite structure $\str{A}, \elemtuplea$ over a (finite) signature $\sigma$.
We describe the finite unraveling $\unravel{A}_{\ell}, \elemtuptuplea_{\ell}$ which will be $\ell$-$\FGF$-bisimilar to $\unravel{A}, \elemtuptuplea$ (and also $\ell$-$\FGF$-bisimilar to $\str{A}, \elemtuplea$ by transitivity of bisimilarity).
For an element $r \in \unraveldom{A}$, we construct the finite tree $\mathcal{T}_{r,\ell}(\unravel{A})$ as follows:
\begin{equation*}
  \mathcal{T}_{r,\ell}(\unravel{A}) = \left\{ e \in \unraveldom{A}:\, e\ \text{is a descendant of $r$ and the length of $\seq{e}$ is at most $2 * \ell$} \right\}.
\end{equation*}

\noindent
$\mathcal{T}_{r,\ell}$ is substructure of $\unravel{A}$.
It is a tree with root $r$ because for every element $e \in \mathcal{T}_{r,\ell} \setminus \{r\}$, the parent of $e$ is also in $\mathcal{T}_{r,\ell}$.
This is easy to see: if $p$ is the parent of $e$, then $p$ is a descendant of $r$ and $\seq{p}$ has a length lower or equal to the length of $\seq{e}$, so $p$ is in $\mathcal{T}_{r,\ell}$.
Furthermore, this tree is finite:
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:bounded-trees-are-finite}
  If $\unravel{A}$ is the unraveling of a finite structure $\str{A}$ with the finite signature $\sigma$, then $\mathcal{T}_{r,\ell}$ is finite for $\ell \in \N$ and $r \in \unraveldom{A}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
If $A$ is finite, then there only a finite number of live tuples in $A$.
Recall that a bisimulation sequence of length $\ell$ is just a word in $A^*{(\N\N{}A^{*})}^{\ell}$, consisting of live tuples from $A^{*}$ and indices into those tuples from $\N\N$.
Let $W$ be the maximum size of a live tuple.
Then an index into a live tuple must be in the range $[1,W]$, which is finite, so the set of possible indices is finite.
Thus there are only a finite number of bisimulation sequences with length $\ell$, since both the set of live tuples and the set of indices is finite.
If $e \in \mathcal{T}_{r,\ell}$ with $\seq{e} = \sigma$, then the length of $\sigma$ is at most $2 * \ell$.
Thus, there are only a finite number of choices for $\sigma$.
For every $\sigma$, there are only a finite number of elements $e \in \unraveldom{A}$ with $\seq{e} = \sigma$.
It follows that there are only finitely many $e$ with $e \in \mathcal{T}_{r,\ell}$, so $\mathcal{T}_{r,\ell}$ is finite.
\end{proof}
Now consider the set $\mathcal{S}$ of trees with $\mathcal{S} = \left\{ \mathcal{T}_{r,\ell}:\, \seq{r}\ \text{has length at most $\ell$}\right\}$.
An element $b$ is called a \emph{cut element} of a tree $\mathcal{T} \in \mathcal{S}$ if it itself is not in $\mathcal{T}$ but $(a,b) \in \relNext$ for some $a$ in $\mathcal{T}$.
Intuitively, the cut elements are elements $e$ where the length of $\seq{e}$ is $2 * \ell + 1$ (so $e$ is not in $\mathcal{T}$) and $\ctr{e}$ is minimal (so there is a $\relNext$-edge from some element $\mathcal{T}$).
The set of all cut elements for trees in $\mathcal{S}$ is finite, because $\mathcal{S}$ is finite and the cut elements of a tree $\mathcal{T}_{r,\ell} \in \mathcal{S}$ are contained in $\mathcal{T}_{r,\ell+1}$ which is finite by \cref{lem:bounded-trees-are-finite}.
Enumerate all cut elements of trees in $\mathcal{S}$ with indices from $1, \ldots, M$, where $M$ is the number of cut elements.
The domain of the structure $\unravel{A}_{\ell}$ consists of $M$ copies of each tree in $\mathcal{S}$.
The relations are defined as in $\unravel{A}$, but with the relation $\relNext$ replaced by by its finitary variant $\relNext_{\ell}$, where $(a,b) \in \relNext_{\ell}$ if:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $(a,b) \in \relNext$, or
  \item $(a,a') \in \relNext$ where $a'$ is a cut element with the associated index $m$, and all of the following are true:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item $b$ is the root of the $m$-th copy of tree in $S$,
          \item $\ctr{b} = \ctr{a'}$,
          \item $\seq{b}$ is the length-$\ell$ suffix of $\seq{a'}$.
        \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\noindent
The structure $\unravel{A}_{\ell}$ is tree-like, in the sense of the following lemma:
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:companion-tree-like}
  Let $D_{a, \ell}(\unravel{A}_{\ell})$ be the set of elements $b$ for which there exists a next-chain starting from $a$ and ending in $b$ of length at most $\ell$.
  For any element $a \in \unraveldom{A}_{\ell}$, the set $D_{a, \ell}$ is a tree.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  \bfbox{write proof}
\end{proof}

In the following, let $\elemtuplea \isoeq \elemtupleb$ denote that $\restr{\str{A}}{\set(\elemtuplea)}$ is isomorphic to $\restr{\str{B}}{\set(\elemtupleb)}$, for tuples $\elemtuplea$ and $\elemtupleb$ from some structures $\str{A}$ and $\str{B}$.
Let $\elemtuptuplea$ and $\elemtuptupleb$ be live tuples from $\unravel{A}_{\ell}$ and $\unravel{B}_{\ell}$.
We employ \cref{lem:companion-tree-like} to show that $\tp{\FGF}{\unravel{A}_{\ell}}{\elemtuptuplea} = \tp{\FGF}{\unravel{B}_{\ell}}{\elemtuptupleb}$ implies $\elemtuptuplea \simeq \elemtuptupleb$, if $\ell$ is large enough:
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:fgf-type-iso}
  Let $\elemtuptuplea$ and $\elemtuptupleb$ be live tuples in finite unravelings $\unravel{A}_{\ell}$ and $\unravel{B}_{\ell}$ of $\sigma$-structures $\str{A}$ and $\str{B}$ for a signature $\sigma$ and a parameter $\ell$.
  If $\ell > W$, where $W$ is the maximum arity\bbeside{Introduce a command for the max arity.} of a relation in $\sigma$, then $\tp{\FGF}{\unravel{A}_{\ell}}{\elemtuptuplea} = \tp{\FGF}{\unravel{B}_{\ell}}{\elemtuptupleb}$ implies $\elemtuptuplea \isoeq \elemtuptupleb$, witnessed by the isomorphism $\mu_{(\elemtuptuplea, \elemtuptupleb)}:\, a_{i} \mapsto b_{i}$ for every $i \in [1, k]$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $\ell > W$ and consider live tuples $\elemtuptuplea \sqin \unraveldom{A}_{\ell}$ and $\elemtuptupleb \sqin \unraveldom{B}_{\ell}$ with equal $\FGF$-types and equal size $k$.
We claim that the map $\mu_{(\elemtuptuplea, \elemtuptupleb)}:\, a_{i} \mapsto b_{i}$ for all $i \in [1, k]$, is an isomorphism between $\restr{\str{\unravel{A}_{\ell}}}{\set(\elemtuptuplea)}$ and $\restr{\str{\unravel{B}_{\ell}}}{\set(\elemtuptupleb)}$.
Let $\elemtuptupler$ be a tuple with $\elemtuptupler \sqin \set(\elemtuptuplea)$ and $\elemtuptupler \in \relR^{\str{A}}$ for some relation $\relR \in \sigma$.
We first show that $\elemtuptupler$ is an infix of $\elemtuptuplea$.
Suppose to the contrary that $\elemtuptupler$ is not an infix of $\elemtuptuplea$, thus there is an $i$ such that $r_{i} = a_{v}$ and $r_{i+1} = a_{w}$ with $v \ne w - 1$.
But then both $(a_{v}, a_{w}) \in \relNext_{\ell}$ and $(a_{w-1}, a_{w}) \in \relNext_{\ell}$ since $\elemtuptupler$ and $\elemtuptuplea$ are $\sigma$-live.
This is a contradiction, since $D_{a_{1}, W}$ defined in \cref{lem:companion-tree-like} includes $a_{v}, a_{w-1}$ and $a_{w}$ but cannot be a tree since $a_{w}$ would have two parents $a_{v}$ and $a_{w-1}$.
Therefore, $\elemtuptupler$ is an infix of $\elemtuptuplea$.
It follows from equality of $\FGF$-types that $\mu_{(\elemtuptuplea, \elemtuptupleb)}[\elemtuptupler] \in \relR^{\str{B}}$.
Since the argument is symmetric, we conclude that elements of $\elemtuptuplea$ and $\elemtuptupleb$ satisfy the same relations so $\mu_{(\elemtuptuplea, \elemtuptupleb)}$ is an isomorphism and $\elemtuptuplea \simeq \elemtuptupleb$.
\end{proof}

Our main goal for the remainder of this section is to show that $\unravel{A}_{\ell} \bisimto_{\GF}^{n} \unravel{B}_{\ell}$, given that $\str{A} \bisimto_{\FGF}^{m} \str{B}$ for some $m$ and $\ell$ that only depends on $n$.
For this proof, we first introduce the notion of $z$-\emph{similar} elements, which is a relation between elements from $\unravel{A}_{\ell}$ and $\unravel{B}_{\ell}$.
We later lift this relation to tuples to construct the $n$-$\GF$-bisimulation.
Intuitively, the idea behind the notion of $z$-similarity is to put elements in relation which behave similar for up to $z$ transitions along $\relNext$-edges, in both forward and backward direction.
In other words, we want to define $z$-similarity such that if $a \in \unraveldom{A}_{\ell}$ and $b \in \unraveldom{B}_{\ell}$ are $z$-similar elements, then for every parent (or child) $c \in \unraveldom{A}_{\ell}$ of $a$, there exists a parent (or child) $d \in \unraveldom{B}_{\ell}$ of $b$ which is $(z-1)$-similar to $c$.
Let us first consider the simpler case of only achieving this property for children (i.e.\ forward transitions along $\relNext$-edges).
We say that elements $a \in \unraveldom{A}_{\ell}$ and $b \in \unraveldom{B}_{\ell}$ are $z$-\emph{forward-similar} if $\ctr{a} = \ctr{b}$, $\seq{a} = \cdots \elemtuples$ and $\seq{b} = \cdots \elemtuplet$ for tuples $\elemtuples$ and $\elemtuplet$ that satisfy $\tp{\FGF_{z}}{\str{A}}{\elemtuples} = \tp{\FGF_{z}}{\str{B}}{\elemtuplet}$.
Note that $\tp{\FGF_{z}}{\str{A}}{\elemtuples} = \tp{\FGF_{z}}{\str{B}}{\elemtuplet}$ is equivalent to $\str{A}, \elemtuples \bisimto_{\FGF}^{z} \str{B}, \elemtuplet$ by \cref{lem:FGF-bisimulations-work-well}.
If $c \in \unraveldom{A}_{\ell}$ is a child of $a$, then by definition of $\relNext_{\ell}$ there are two possible situations, either (\romannumeral1) $c$ has the same sequence as $a$ but an incremented counter, or (\romannumeral2) $c$ adds a move to the sequence of $a$ (possibly removing elements from the beginning of the sequence if the result is too long).
In both cases, we can find a child $b$ that $(z-1)$-forward-similar to $c$: in case (\romannumeral1) we simply increment the counter of $b$, whereas in case (\romannumeral2) we employ~\ref{bisim:fforth} to find a move in $\str{B}$ that we can add to the end of the sequence of $b$ to obtain a child $d$ of $b$ so that the (new) last tuples of $\seq{c}$ and $\seq{d}$ have equal $\FGF_{z-1}$ types.

We now consider the general case, including backward transitions.
As we saw above, forward transitions along $\relNext$-edges extend the sequence of an element by adding moves to the end.
If we allow backward transitions, then we need to consider the opposite case: that moves are removed from the end of the sequence.
It is thus no longer sufficient to only look at the type of the last tuple in a sequence.
Instead, we need to consider the types of the last $z$ tuples.
For this, we introduce the auxilliary notion of $z$-histories:
\begin{definition}[$z$-history]
  Let $\str{A}$ be a structure and $\ell$ be a parameter.
  The $z$-\emph{history} of an element $a \in \unraveldom{A}$ with $\seq{a} = \elemtuples^{(0)} \cdots (i^{n}, j^{n})\elemtuples^{n}$ for some $n \in \N$, tuples $\elemtuples^{(0)}, \ldots, \elemtuples^{(n)}$ and indices $i^{(1)}, \ldots, i^{(n)}$ and $j^{(1)}, \ldots, j^{(n)}$ is denoted by $\hist{z}{a}$ and defined as:
  \begin{equation*}
    \hist{z}{a} = \tp{\FGF_{z}}{\str{A}}{\elemtuples^{(n-h)}}(i^{(n-h+1)}, j^{(n-h+1)})\tp{\FGF_{z}}{\str{A}}{\elemtuples^{(n-h+1)}}\cdots(i^{n}, j^{n})\tp{\FGF_{z}}{\str{A}}{\elemtuples^{(n)}}
  \end{equation*}
  where $h = \mathsf{min}(z, n)$. If $h < z$, then $\hist{z}{a}$ is called a \emph{short $z$-history}.
\end{definition}
This definition is analogous to a construction used by Otto in the upgrading from global bisimulation to two-way global bisismulation for modal logic~\cite[Def. 39]{Otto04}.
We define $z$-similar elements to be those elements which have equal $z$-histories and equal counters:
\begin{definition}[$z$-similar elements]
 Let $e \in \unraveldom{A}_{\ell}$ and $f \in \unraveldom{B}_{\ell}$ be domain elements, and $z$ be a natural number. Then $e$ and $f$ are $z$-similar, written $e \approx_{z} f$, if $\ctr{e} = \ctr{f}$ and $\hist{z}{e} = \hist{z}{f}$.
\end{definition}
Note that if $\hist{z}{e}$ is a short $z$-history, then $\hist{z}{f}$ must also be a short $z$-history.
So if either $\seq{e}$ or $\seq{f}$ has a length less than $z$ and $e$ is $z$-similar to $f$, then $\seq{e}$ and $\seq{f}$ have the same length.
Compared to the notion of $z$-forward-similarity, $z$-similarity requires not just the $\FGF_{z}$-type of the last tuple in the sequences to match.
Rather, it additionally requires that the types of the $z$ last tuples of the sequences are equal.
Because of this, $z$-similar elements have both $(z-1)$-similar children and $(z-1)$-similar parents, as stated in the next lemma:
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:approx-next}
  Let $a \in \unraveldom{A}_{\ell}$ and $b \in \unraveldom{B}_{\ell}$. If $a \approx_{z} b$ for some $z \in [1,\ell]$, then:
  \begin{description}
    \item[\desclabel{(succ)}{elemeq:succ}] If $(a, c) \in \relNext_{\ell}$ for $c \in \unraveldom{A}_{\ell}$, then there is $d \in \unraveldom{B}_{\ell}$ with $(b, d) \in \relNext_{\ell}$ and $c \approx_{z-1} d$.
    \item[\desclabel{(pred)}{elemeq:pred}] If $(c, a) \in \relNext_{\ell}$ for $c \in \unraveldom{A}_{\ell}$, then there is $d \in \unraveldom{B}_{\ell}$ with $(d, b) \in \relNext_{\ell}$ and $c \approx_{z-1} d$.
  \end{description}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proofsketch}
  Since $(a,c) \in \relNext_{\ell}$ or $(c,a) \in \relNext_{\ell}$, we have three cases:
  \begin{romanenumerate}
    \item only counter changed: $\seq{a} = \seq{c}$ and $\ctr{c} = \ctr{a} \pm 1$,
    \item sequence extended: $\seq{c} = \mathsf{trunc}_{\ell}[\seq{a} (i,j) \elemtuples]$ and $\ctr{c} = j-i+1$, or
    \item sequence reduced: $\seq{c}$ is such that $\seq{a} = \mathsf{trunc}_{\ell}[\seq{c} (i,j) \elemtuples]$.
  \end{romanenumerate}
  where
  \begin{displaymath}
    \mathsf{trunc}_{\ell}[\sigma] =
    \begin{cases}
      \sigma & \text{if $\sigma$ has length at most $2 * \ell$} \\
      \text{length-$\ell$ suffix of $\sigma$} & \text{if $\sigma$ has length greater than $2 * \ell$}
    \end{cases}
  \end{displaymath}.
  Note that case (\romannumeral2) is possible only for~\ref{elemeq:succ} and (\romannumeral3) only for~\ref{elemeq:pred}.

  In case (\romannumeral1), $a$ and $c$ have the same history.
  We can find an element $d$ with $(b,d) \in \relNext_{\ell}$ (or $(d,b) \in \relNext_{\ell}$) by incrementing (or decrementing) the counter of $b$ accordingly, keeping the history the same, thus $c \approx_{z-1} d$ (in fact, even $c \approx_{z} d$).
  It can be seen that $\hist{1}{a} = \hist{1}{b}$ and $c \in \unraveldom{A}_{\ell}$ implies $d \in \unraveldom{B}_{\ell}$.

  In case (\romannumeral2), we employ the fact that the last tuples of $\seq{a}$ and $\seq{b}$ have the same $\FGF_{z}$ type.
  Thus, we can find a tuple $\elemtuplet$ such that $\seq{b} (i,j) \elemtuplet$ is a bisimulation sequence and $\elemtuplet$ has the same $\FGF_{z-1}$ type as $\elemtuples$.
  Next, we construct the element $d$ with $\seq{d} = \mathsf{trunc}_{\ell}[\seq{b}(i,j)\elemtuplet]$ and $\ctr{d} = (j-i+1) + 1$.
  Cleary, $d \in \unraveldom{B}_{\ell}$ and $(b,d) \in \relNext_{\ell}$.
  The function $\mathsf{trunc}_{\ell}$ preserves suffixes of length $z$ since $z \le \ell$, so it does not affect $z$-histories.
  By our choice of $\elemtuplet$, we have $\hist{z-1}{c} = \hist{z-1}{d}$.
  It follows that $c \approx_{z-1} d$, as wanted.

  In case (\romannumeral3), by equivalence of $z$-histories, we know that $\seq{b} = \mathsf{trunc}_{\ell}[\sigma \cdots(i,j)\elemtuplet]$ for some tuple $\elemtuplet$ and a bismimulation sequence $\sigma$ of length at most $2 * \ell$.
  Further, by equivalence of counters, $\ctr{b} = \ctr{a} = (j-i+1) + 1$.
  By definition of the unraveling, there is an element $d \in \unraveldom{B}_{\ell}$ with $(d,b) \in \relNext_{\ell}$, which has $\seq{d} = \sigma$.
  This element satisfies $c \approx_{z-1} d$.
\end{proofsketch}
\begin{proof}
  Since $(a,c) \in \relNext_{\ell}$ or $(c,a) \in \relNext_{\ell}$, we have three cases:
  \begin{romanenumerate}
    \item only counter changed: $\seq{a} = \seq{c}$ and $\ctr{c} = \ctr{a} \pm 1$,
    \item sequence extended: $\seq{c} = \mathsf{trunc}_{\ell}[\seq{a} (i,j) \elemtuples]$ and $\ctr{c} = j-i+1$, or
    \item sequence reduced: $\seq{c}$ is such that $\seq{a} = \mathsf{trunc}_{\ell}[\seq{c} (i,j) \elemtuples]$.
  \end{romanenumerate}
  where
  \begin{displaymath}
    \mathsf{trunc}_{\ell}[\sigma] =
    \begin{cases}
      \sigma & \text{if $\sigma$ has length at most $2 * \ell$} \\
      \text{length-$\ell$ suffix of $\sigma$} & \text{if $\sigma$ has length greater than $2 * \ell$}
    \end{cases}
  \end{displaymath}.
  Note that case (\romannumeral2) is possible only for~\ref{elemeq:succ} and (\romannumeral3) only for~\ref{elemeq:pred}.

  In case (\romannumeral1), $a$ and $c$ have the same history.
  We can find an element $d$ with $(b,d) \in \relNext_{\ell}$ (or $(d,b) \in \relNext_{\ell}$) by incrementing (or decrementing) the counter of $b$ accordingly, keeping the history the same, thus $c \approx_{z-1} d$ (in fact, even $c \approx_{z} d$).
  We claim that this element $d$ is in $\unraveldom{B}_{\ell}$.
  We consider two cases: either $\seq{a} = \elemtuples$ or $\seq{a} = \cdots (i,j) \elemtuples$, for some tuple $\elemtuples$.
  Since $b$ has the same $z$-history as $a$, there is a tuple $\elemtuplet$ with the same $\FGF_{z}$ type as $s$ such that $\seq{b} = \elemtuplet$ or $\seq{b} = \cdots (i,j) \elemtuplet$, respectively.
  Since $\elemtuples$ and $\elemtuplet$ have equal types, $|\elemtuplet| = |\elemtuples|$.
  Further, we have $\ctr{c} = \ctr{d}$.
  We can see that in this case, the conditions for $d$ to be in $\unraveldom{B}_{\ell}$ are equivalent to the conditions for $c$ to be in $\unraveldom{A}_{\ell}$.
  As we know that $c \in \unraveldom{A}_{\ell}$, it follows that $d$ is in $\unraveldom{B}_{\ell}$.

  In case (\romannumeral2), we employ the fact that the last tuples of $\seq{a}$ and $\seq{b}$ have the same $\FGF_{z}$ type, due to their equal $z$-histories.
  Thus, we can find a tuple $\elemtuplet$ such that $\seq{b} (i,j) \elemtuplet$ is a bisimulation sequence and $\elemtuplet$ has the same $\FGF_{z-1}$ type as $\elemtuples$.
  Next, we construct the element $d$ with $d = (\mathsf{trunc}_{\ell}[\sigma], \ctr{c})$ for $\sigma = \seq{b}(i,j)\elemtuplet$.
  By construction, $d \in \unraveldom{B}_{\ell}$ and $(b,d) \in \relNext_{\ell}$ (recall that $\ctr{c} = (j-i+1)+1$).
  Observe that $\mathsf{trunc}_{\ell}$ preserves suffixes of length $z$, since $z \le \ell$.
  Hence, the $(z-1)$-history of the element $c$ is equal to the $(z-1)$-history of an element $e$ with $e = (\seq{a}(i,j)\elemtuples, \ctr{c})$.
  Similary, the $(z-1)$-history of $d$ is equal to the $(z-1)$-history of an element $f$ with $f = (\seq{b}(i,j)\elemtuplet, \ctr{d})$.
  As $\elemtuples$ and $\elemtuplet$ have the same $\FGF_{z-1}$-type, we can see that $\hist{z-1}{e} = \hist{z-1}{f}$ and hence $\hist{z-1}{c} = \hist{z-1}{d}$.
  It follows that $c \approx_{z-1} d$, as wanted.

  In case (\romannumeral3), by equivalence of $z$-histories, we know that $\seq{b} = \mathsf{trunc}_{\ell}[\sigma(i,j)\elemtuplet]$ for some tuple $\elemtuplet$ and a bismimulation sequence $\sigma$ of length at most $2 * \ell$.
  Further, by equivalence of counters, $\ctr{b} = \ctr{a} = (j-i+1) + 1$.
  By definition of the unraveling, there is an element $d \in \unraveldom{B}_{\ell}$ with $(d,b) \in \relNext_{\ell}$, which has $\seq{d} = \sigma$.
  Again, because $\mathsf{trunc}_{\ell}$ preserves suffixes of length $z$, the $z$-history of $b$ is equal to the $z$-history of an element $b'$ with $b' = (\sigma(i,j)\elemtuplet, \ctr{b})$.
  As $\seq{d} = \sigma$, the $(z-1)$-history of $d$ is equal to the $z$-history of $b'$ minus the last step.
  As $b$ and $a$ have the same $z$-history and the $(z-1)$-history of $c$ is also equal to the $z$-history of $a$ minus the last step, it follows that $c$ and $d$ have equal $(z-1)$-histories.
  Further, both $\ctr{c} = j$ and $\ctr{d} = j$.
  This follows from $(c,a) \in \relNext_{\ell}$ and $(d,b) \in \relNext_{\ell}$.
  Hence, $c \approx_{z-1} d$ as required.
\end{proof}

Let us now consider live tuples $\elemtuptuplea \sqin \unraveldom{A}_{\ell}$ and $\elemtuptupleb \sqin \unraveldom{B}_{\ell}$ with $\elemtuptuplea = (a_{1}, \ldots, a_{k})$ and $\elemtuptupleb = (b_{1}, \ldots, b_{k})$ where $a_{i} \approx_{z} b_{i}$ for every $i \in [1,k]$.
We say that $\elemtuptuplea$ and $\elemtuptupleb$ are \emph{tuples of $z$-similar elements}.
We show that in this case, $\elemtuptuplea$ and $\elemtuptupleb$ have the same $\FGF$-type, which further implies by \cref{lem:fgf-type-iso} that they are isomorphic.
Let $\elemtuples$ and $\elemtuplet$ be the tuples from $\str{A}$ and $\str{B}$ such that $\seq{a_{k}} = \cdots \elemtuples$ and $\seq{b_{k}} = \cdots \elemtuplet$.
Since $a_{k} \approx_z b_{k}$, we have $\elemtuples \bisimto_{\FGF}^{z} \elemtuplet$ which in particular implies that $\elemtuples$ and $\elemtuplet$ have the same $\FGF$-type.
Observe that $\pi[\elemtuptuplea] = \elemtuples_{(\ctr{a_{k}}-k)\ldots{}\ctr{a_{k}}}$ and likewise $\pi[\elemtuptupleb] = \elemtuplet_{(\ctr{b_{k}}-k)\ldots{}\ctr{b_{k}}}$.
This follows from \cref{lem:projection-next} since $\elemtuptuplea$ and $\elemtuptupleb$ are live and thus must be next-chains.
As $\ctr{a_{k}} = \ctr{b_{k}}$, both $\elemtuptuplea$ and $\elemtuptupleb$ project to infixes $\elemtuples_{i\ldots{}j}$ and $\elemtuplet_{i\ldots{}j}$ over the common range $i\ldots{}j$ for $i = \ctr{a_{k}} - k$ and $j = \ctr{a_{k}}$.
Hence, $\FGF$-types of $\pi[\elemtuptuplea]$ and $\pi[\elemtuptupleb]$ are also equal.
Now consider an infix $\elemtuptuplea_{x\ldots{}y}$ and the corresponding infix $\elemtuptupleb_{x\ldots{}y}$, for some indices $x$ and $y$.
Our claim is that $\elemtuptuplea_{x\ldots{}y}$ and $\elemtuptupleb_{x\ldots{}y}$ are in the same relations.
We prove this claim by examining the three conditions of the definition of relations in the unraveling in turn.
We show that each condition is true for $\elemtuptuplea_{x\ldots{}y}$ if and only if it is true for $\elemtuptupleb_{x\ldots{}y}$.
Let $\relR$ be any relational symbol. Then:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\pi[\elemtuptuplea_{x\ldots{}y}] \in \relR^{\str{A}}$ if and only if $\pi[\elemtuptuplea_{x\ldots{}y}] \in \relR^{\str{B}}$, because $\pi[\elemtuptuplea]$ and $\pi[\elemtuptupleb]$ have equal $\FGF$-types,
  \item $\elemtuptuplea_{x\ldots{}y}$ is a next-chain if and only if $\elemtuptupleb_{x\ldots{}y}$ is a next-chain, because both infixes are always next-chains since $\elemtuptuplea$ and $\elemtuptupleb$ are next-chains as they are live,
  \item $|\elemtuptuplea_{x\ldots{}y}| \le \mathtt{bound}(\elemtuptuplea_{x\ldots{}y})$ if and only if $|\elemtuptupleb_{x\ldots{}y}| \le \mathtt{bound}(\elemtuptupleb_{x\ldots{}y})$ because $|\elemtuptuplea_{x\ldots{}y}| = |\elemtuptupleb_{x\ldots{}y}| = y-x+1$ and $\mathtt{bound}(\elemtuptuplea_{x\ldots{}y}) = \mathtt{bound}(\elemtuptupleb_{x\ldots{}y})$ since $\ctr{a_{j}} = \ctr{b_{j}}$ follows from $a_{j} \approx_{z} b_{j}$.
\end{enumerate}
Therefore, infixes of $\elemtuptuplea$ and $\elemtuptupleb$ are in the same relations.
We conclude that $\elemtuptuplea$ and $\elemtuptupleb$ have equal $\FGF$-types.

Finally, we employ the notion of tuples with $z$-similar elements to construct a $n$-$\GF$-bisimulation between finite unravelings:
\begin{lemma}
  Let $\str{A}$ and $\str{B}$ be structures over a signature $\sigma$ and $W = \arity(\sigma)$.
  If $\str{A} \bisimto_{\FGF}^{W * n} \str{B}$, then there is a $n$-$GF$-bisimulation between $\unravel{A}_{W * n}$ and $\unravel{B}_{W * n}$, given by the sequence of sets $\bisimZ_{0}, \ldots, \bisimZ_{n} \subseteq \PartIso{\unravel{A}_{W * n}}{\unravel{B}_{W * n}}$ defined as:
  \begin{equation*}
    \bisimZ_{k} = \left\{
      \mu_{(\elemtuptuples, \elemtuptuplet)}:\,
      \elemtuptuples\ \text{and}\ \elemtuptuplet\ \text{are live and}\ \
      s_{i} \approx_{W * k} t_{i}\ \text{for all indices $i$}
    \right\}
  \end{equation*}
  where $\mu_{(\elemtuptuples, \elemtuptuplet)}$ is the isomorphism between $\elemtuptuples$ and $\elemtuptuplet$ as in \cref{lem:fgf-type-iso}.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proofsketch}
  We show that $\bisimZ_{k-1}$ satisfies~\ref{bisim:forth} for $\bisimZ_{k}$, the proof for the condition~\ref{bisim:back} is symmetric.
  Let $\elemtuptuplea$ be a live tuple in $\unravel{A}_{W * n}$ and $\mu_{(\elemtuptuples, \elemtuptuplet)} \in \bisimZ_{k}$.
  We differentiate between two cases: (i) $\elemtuptuplea$ and $\elemtuptuples$ have at least one common element and (ii) $\elemtuptuplea$ and $\elemtuptuples$ have no common elements.
  \begin{romanenumerate}
    \item
    Due to the tree-like nature of the unraveling, there are indices $i$ and $j$ such that the infix $\elemtuptuples_{i\ldots{}j}$ contains all the common elements of $\elemtuptuplea$ and $\elemtuptuples$, and elements of $\elemtuptuples$ outside of this infix are not contained in $\elemtuptuplea$.
    Similarly, there are also indices $v$ and $w$ such that $\elemtuptuplea_{v\ldots{}w} = \elemtuptuples_{i\ldots{}j}$ and no element of $\elemtuptuplea$ outside of this infix is contained in $\elemtuptuples$.
    We iteratively apply \ref{elemeq:pred} and \ref{elemeq:succ} from \cref{lem:approx-next} to find elements $b_{1}, \cdots, b_{v-1}$ and $b_{w+1}, \cdots, b_{|\elemtuptuplea|}$ from $\unravel{B}_{W * n}$ such that $\elemtuptupleb$ with $\elemtuptupleb = b_{1}\cdots{}b_{v-1}\elemtuptuplet_{i\ldots{}j}b_{w+1}\cdots{}b_{|a|}$ is componentwise $(W*(k-1))$-similar to $\elemtuptuplea$.
    Then the isomorphism $\mu_{(\elemtuptuplea,\elemtuptupleb)}$ is in $Z_{k-1}$.
    The common domain of $\mu_{(\elemtuptuples,\elemtuptuplet)}$ and $\mu_{(\elemtuptuplea,\elemtuptupleb)}$ is $\set(\elemtuptuplea_{v\ldots{}w})$, on which $\mu_{(\elemtuptuples,\elemtuptuplet)}$ and $\mu_{(\elemtuptuplea,\elemtuptupleb)}$ agree since $\elemtuptuplea_{v\ldots{}w} = \elemtuptuples_{i\ldots{}j}$ and $\elemtuptupleb_{v\ldots{}w} = \elemtuptuplet_{i\ldots{}j}$.
    This satsifies the requirements for~\ref{bisim:forth}.

    \item
    If $\elemtuptuplea$ and $\elemtuptuples$ have no common elements, then we first find an element $b_{1} \in \unraveldom{B}_{W * n}$ that is $(W * k)$-similar to $a_{1}$.
    We can find such an element by employing~\ref{bisim:forth} $W * k$ times.\bfside{make bit more precise using $(W * k)$-ends}
    Similar to case (i), we now use~\ref{elemeq:succ} to find elements $b_{2}, \ldots, b_{|\elemtuptuplea|} \in \unraveldom{B}_{W * n}$ such that the tuple $\elemtuptupleb$ with $\elemtuptupleb = (b_{1}, \ldots, b_{|\elemtuptuplea|})$ is $W * (k - 1)$-similar to $\elemtuptuplea$.
    Then $\mu_{(\elemtuptuplea, \elemtuptupleb)} \in Z_{k-1}$ satisfies the requirements for~\ref{bisim:forth}.
  \end{romanenumerate}
\end{proofsketch}
\begin{proof}
  We need to show that $\bisimZ_{k-1}$ satisfies the~\ref{bisim:back} and~\ref{bisim:forth} conditions for $\bisimZ_{k}$, for all $k \in [1, n]$.
  By symmetry, it suffices to show~\ref{bisim:forth}.
  Let $\elemtuptuplea$ be a live tuple in $\unravel{A}_{W * n}$ and $\mu_{(\elemtuptuples, \elemtuptuplet)} \in \bisimZ_{k}$.

  For structures $\str{A}$ and $\str{B}$ and every element $a \in \unraveldom{A}_{\ell}$, we can find a $z$-similar element $b \in \unraveldom{B}_{\ell}$, given that $\str{A} \bisimto_{\FGF}^{z} \str{B}$, as follows.
  Let $\seq{a} = \elemtuples^{(0)}\cdots(i^{{n}}, j^{(n)})\elemtuples^{(n)}$ and $m$ be the minimum of $z$ and $n$.
  Using~\ref{bisim:fforth} $m$ times, we obtain live tuples $\elemtuplet^{(0)}, \ldots, \elemtuplet^{(m)}$ with $(\elemtuples^{(n-m)}, \elemtuplet^{(0)}) \in \bisimZ_{2*z}, \ldots, (\elemtuples^{(n)}, \elemtuplet^{(m)}) \in \bisimZ_{2*z - m}$ such that $\elemtuplet^{(0)}(i^{(n-m+1)}, j^{(n-m+1)})\elemtuplet^{(1)}\cdots{}(i^{n}, j^{n})\elemtuplet^{(m)}$ is a bisimulation sequence.
  For any bisimulation it holds that $\bisimZ_{0} \supseteq \bisimZ_{1} \supseteq \cdots{} \supseteq \bisimZ_{2*z+1}$, thus for every x, $(\elemtuples^{(n-m+x)}, \elemtuplet^{(x)}) \in \bisimZ_{2*z - m}$.
  Hence, since $z \le 2*z - m$, for every $x$, the tuples $\elemtuples^{(n-m+x)}$ and $\elemtuplet^{(x)}$ are $z$-$\FGF$-bisimilar.
  We can now construct the element $b$ with $\ctr{b} = \ctr{a}$ and $\seq{b} = \elemtuplet^{(0)}(i^{(n-m+1)}, j^{(n-m+1)})\elemtuplet^{(1)}\cdots{}(i^{n}, j^{n})\elemtuplet^{(m)}$.
  This satisfies $a \approx_{z} b$, as wanted.
\end{proof}
